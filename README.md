# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a **Modern data warehouse using SQL Server** to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems and enable analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

It is built as a **Personal portfolio project** to showcase practical data engineering and analytics skills, including data integration, data quality handling, dimensional modeling, and SQL-based analysis.

This project addresses that challenge by:
- Centralizing data into a single warehouse
- Cleaning and standardizing datasets
- Designing an analytics-friendly data model
- Enabling fast and consistent reporting

- **Data Sources**: Imported data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files  
- **Data Quality**: Cleansed and resolved data quality issues prior to analysis  
- **Integration**: Combined both sources into a single, user-friendly analytical data model  
- **Scope**: Focused on the latest dataset only (no historical tracking)
